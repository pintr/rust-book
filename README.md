# rust-book
Project containing examples from "The Rust Programming Language" book.

This repository provides a hands-on approach to learning Rust by following the official book, with code examples organized by chapter.

## Usage

Each chapter is a separate Cargo project. To run an example, navigate to the chapter's directory and use `cargo run`.

For example, to run the "Hello, world!" example:
```sh
cd c01_hello_world
cargo run
```
